Full Stack Developer (Node.js/ React.js) Machine Test      

Node.js  
Test 1: Express.js Middleware and Routing  Build a RESTful API using Express.js that supports CRUD operations on a resource (e.g., users). Implement middleware for authentication, authorization, and logging. Handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.  
Test 2: Database Integration (e.g., MongoDB)  Create a Node.js application that connects to a MongoDB database and performs the following operations:  Creates a collection. Inserts multiple documents into the collection. Queries the collection for specific documents. Updates existing documents. Deletes documents from the collection.  

React.js 
Test 1: Form Handling and Validation Create a form component that collects user input, validates the data, and submits it to an API.  Test 2: Context API or Redux Implement a state management solution (Context API or Redux) to share data across multiple components in a React application. 

Machine Test Overview for Full Stack Developer (Node.js/React.js)
Your machine test is well-structured to assess both backend and frontend skills. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each test section:

Node.js
Test 1: Express.js Middleware and Routing

Objective: Build a RESTful API to manage a resource (e.g., users).
Key Features:
Implement middleware functions for:
Authentication: Verify user identity (e.g., using JWT).
Authorization: Check user permissions for accessing certain resources.
Logging: Log incoming requests and responses for monitoring.
Handle different HTTP methods:
GET: Retrieve resource(s).
POST: Create a new resource.
PUT: Update an existing resource.
DELETE: Remove a resource.
Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, 401 for unauthorized).
Test 2: Database Integration (e.g., MongoDB)

Objective: Connect a Node.js application to a MongoDB database.
Key Operations:
Create a Collection: Set up a new collection in MongoDB.
Insert Documents: Add multiple entries to the collection.
Query Documents: Fetch specific documents based on criteria.
Update Documents: Modify existing documents.
Delete Documents: Remove documents from the collection.
React.js
Test 1: Form Handling and Validation

Objective: Create a form that captures user input.
Key Features:
Validate input data (e.g., using client-side validation libraries or custom validation).
Submit the data to the backend API you created in the Node.js section.
Provide feedback to the user (e.g., success or error messages).
Test 2: Context API or Redux

Objective: Implement a state management solution.
Key Features:
Use the Context API or Redux to manage global state.
Share data across multiple components effectively.
Ensure that changes in the state are reflected in the UI without prop drilling.
